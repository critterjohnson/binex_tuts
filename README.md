# Binary Exploitation Tutorials
Welcome! Each folder within this repo hosts a challenge which holds a common programming bug which can be exploited. Each challenge explains what you need to do and how to 'win'. This is an ongoing project which will be ubdated as I create more tutorials! If you find any issues, please reach out and let me know (if you know me directly). Enjoy!
